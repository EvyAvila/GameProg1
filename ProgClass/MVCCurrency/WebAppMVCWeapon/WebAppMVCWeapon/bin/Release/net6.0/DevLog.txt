Dev log 1 - Evy Avila

I've used the same objects from the WPF project with using Weapons. I changed some 
data types that were difficult before. There were no major blocks, however, I do
question on whether the button commands were correct or if there is a better way
of making them. I based it from a tutorial demonstration site. Another issue I 
noticed was how the certain parameters didn't like to reference an interface,
especially if needing to create a new weapon. Then, there was an issue with my
reload weapon, but that was needing to include the MaxAmmoAmount. Finally,
there was an issue of getting the ID number, but that was quickly fixed after
realizing that I hadn't removed the comments to include the Id. 

I did take a while to complete this, but part of it was fixing the issues and 
also experimenting with colors, changing text, and styles.
