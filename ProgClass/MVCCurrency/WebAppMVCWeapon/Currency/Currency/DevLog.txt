Slight rant: Took way too long for me to complete, but I was trying to make sure I 
understood each test and method. 

I was able to get the tests to turn green at the end of the assignment. For the project
itself, I don't fully understand when to use the methods MakeChange and CreateChange. I 
assumed CreateChanged called MakeChange, in which the math takes place. A most likely
technical debt as I just wanted to have the test pass. 

My main concern is with MakeChangeTests. I noticed that in line 151, there was a cast
for the class. However, the rest didn't contain a cast. I'm not sure if they were 
missing a cast or it was intentinal. 
That being said, I did a weird thing. As technical debt, I create a method which
uses the class name, but contains the method name. It seems to remove the issue, but I find
it wrong. If I use the original version of ICurrencyRepo, the test will complain and I
would need to add a cast to each of them. 
When I did add the cast, it did work correctly with using the ICurrencyRepo. I've kept both
versions in the code, with one commented out.

I used Mexican Money as my international currency, which uses pesos.

Key:
Pesos mean weight, and are used from the ones place and up.
Centavos translate as cents and operate the same.

I decided to include banknotes along with the coins.

Order from highest to lowest 

Bank Notes:
$1,000 pesos
$500 pesos
$200 pesos
$100 pesos
$50 pesos
$20 pesos

Coins:
$10 pesos
$5 pesos
$2 pesos
$1 pesos
$0.50 centavos
$0.20 centavos
$0.10 centavos
$0.05 centavos

Note: I didn't know if the international currency repo needed its own version of a generic 
currency repo, so I did make another one with the added bank notes and for the calculations.
If I were to redo this, I would make it so the make change method include the list of the 
currency for any coin and bank note.
