The modification used was an additional method for XNOR and OR gates.

The purpose was to view the new input data to check the likelyhood of rain,
which is basing on pressure, wind speed, cloud patterns, and temperature. 

I focused more on the test data than the output, which caused some of the results
to be far off than the original.
